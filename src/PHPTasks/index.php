                Is coffee good or bad for your health?

                Although early studies of coffee suggested that it could lead to
                health problems, recent research provides strong evidence that
                drinking coffee actually has a variety of health benefits. “The
                overall evidence has been pretty convincing that coffee has been
                more healthful than harmful in terms of health outcomes,” said
                Frank Hu, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H.
                Chan School of Public Health, in an April 5, 2021, article in
                Discover. “For most people, moderate coffee consumption can be
                incorporated into a healthy diet.” Hu said that moderate coffee
                intake about 2-5 cups a day is linked to a lower likelihood of
                type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver and endometrial cancers,
                Parkinson's disease, and depression. It's even possible that
                people who drink coffee can reduce their risk of early death.

                    Early research linked coffee to diseases ranging from heart
                    disease and asthma. But Hu noted that many participants in those
                    studies also smoked, which may have led researchers to think
                    that coffee was responsible for the adverse effects that are now
                    linked with cigarettes. He added that anything people consume a
                    lot of tends to come under scrutiny. “In the past, I think a lot
                    of people thought, "Oh, coffee's so delicious, there must be
                    something bad about coffee", he said. “So I think the good news
                    is that [for] most people, coffee actually confers some health
                    benefits.” Certain groups should be careful about drinking
                    coffee, according to the article. Not much is known about the
                    effects of coffee on children, and caffeine could be harmful to
                    pregnancies. Too much caffeine can also cause anxiety in people
                    with panic or anxiety disorders. For those who drink coffee,
                    experts suggest brewing it with a paper filter, because
                    unfiltered coffee is associated with higher rates of early
                    death, and can contain compounds that raise levels of LDL, or
                    “bad,” cholesterol. They also advise not going overboard with
                    added cream or sugar.
